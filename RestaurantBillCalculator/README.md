should display all following menu items (shown below) in four ComboBoxes. Each ComboBox should contain a 
category of food offered by the restaurant (Beverage, Appetizer, Main Course and Dessert).
The user can choose from one of these ComboBoxes to add an item to a table’s bill. As each item is
selected in the ComboBoxes, add to the DataGrid Control, and add the price of that item to the bill. 
The user can click the Clear Bill Button to restore the Subtotal:, Tax: and Total: fields  to $0.00.
